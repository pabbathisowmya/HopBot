# HopBot

 ##  ABSTRACT:
Hop bot is used to jump over any obstacle of height of comparable dimension to that of the bot. Motor, Springs and Gears are used for its proper functioning along with a pair of Non-motorized wheels.

 ## INTRODUCTION:
A jumping robot can cross the obstacle several times its own height and has a good ability to avoid risks. It can be applied to the occasion with complex and changeable environment, such as detection of planet surface, post disaster relief, and military reconnaissance. 

Military and disaster management teams sometimes come across such situations where they need a robot which can be operated in any terrain, could easily overcome obstacles and is efficient. There we need hop bot which occupies less space, could skip obstacles by jumping mechanism and can work in almost every terrain.

While designing we took hint from the hoping of locust and grasshopper. In nature, a locust will first orient its body to the desired direction with its forelegs and then propel its jumps via rapid movement of its hind legs, thereby converting stored energy to the acceleration of its body. 

The jumping processes of locusts have been extensively investigated. During its jump phase, the center of mass (COM) of the locust's body travels along an almost perfect line, which is parallel to the line drawn from the distal end of the tibia through the proximal end of the femur. The elevation angle of the locust is determined by the initial position of its hind legs.

We used the springs for replacing the muscle power. The spring has the advantages of strong energy storage, fast energy release, simple structure, and simple control.

 ## MECHANICAL ASPECTS: 

 ###  _DC MOTOR_:

 #### _Design:_ DC motors take electrical power through direct current, and convert this energy into mechanical rotation. DC motors use magnetic fields that occur from the electrical currents generated, which powers the movement of a rotor fixed within the output shaft. The output torque and speed depends upon both the electrical input and the design of the motor.
